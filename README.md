This repo is the result of a hands-on exercise following [this nice tutorial](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/) on Rust → WebAssembly development and deployment.

Note that this tutorial is a bit outdated, especially in the part about web deployment. Newer Webpack solutions, etc., should have been incorporated.

## Bitaggy TODO List

This repo was previously intended for a lightweight reading list + bibliography manager for CS papers, named Bitaggy. I later found that [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a great solution for what I wanted (and more), so this project is now suspended.
